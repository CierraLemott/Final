        <h5 class="title1">Photographer & Journalist</h5>
        <p class="firstpara">My name is Cierra Lemott. I'm a junior at Columbia College Chicago majoring in journalism with minors in photography and social media & digital strategy. I was introduced to journalism through True Star Media's editorial program via After School Matters during my sophomore year of high school when I attended Brooks College Prep. I currently work for True Star Media as Lead Reporter and Communications Assistant. I also work for the Columbia Chronicle as a Multimedia Reporter. In addition to my contribution to these two publications, I have my own blog titled <a href="https://kodakscorner.com/">Kodak's Corner</a>, which is my corner of the Internet where I'm free to express my thoughts on topics that interest me. Journalism and photography have given me an outlet and a voice to represent those who are often silenced.

          <p>I've been taking pictures for as long as I can remember. My mom is a huge contributor toward this as she always had a camera in hand, capturing memories. I decided to explore the world of photojournalism as a way to cater to both my love of photography and my love of journalism. </p>

          <p>My journalism career began in the summer of 2017 when I was a part of True Star Media's editorial team for the first time. From there, I moved from working only during the After School Matters sessions to working directly for True Star year-round as a freelance journalist. I've gone on to have hundreds of published works on True Star's blog which can be found <a href="https://truestar.life/?s=cierra+lemott">here</a>. 

            In the summer of 2021, I made a blog called Kodak's Corner where I write about things that are more personal to me.
            
            I began working for the Columbia Chronicle as a staff reporter in the fall of 2022 where I've published some written works that can be viewed <a href="https://columbiachronicle.com/?s=cierra+lemott&submit=Search">here</a>.</p>
